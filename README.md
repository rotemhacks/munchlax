This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What does this mean for the tech stack?

## What does it do?

It (will) lets you track your food without yelling at you. Calorie goal optional. Calorie display optional. Also maybe have your friends leave you little encouraging messages down the line?

## Why?

Some people have EDs, or don't want to diet and are tracking food issues, we don't all want to be yelled at for eating a piece of toast over our calorie goal.

## Munchlax?

It's a code name, of course.
Isn't it cute?
